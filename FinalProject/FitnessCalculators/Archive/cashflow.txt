Cash flow is essentially your income minus your expenses.

A negative cash floow means you’re spending more than you bring in. This may deplete your

savings or increase your debt. A positive cash flow indicates that you’re living within your

means. If the result is a negative cash flow, you can take steps to reduce your expenses or

seek additional sources of income.
