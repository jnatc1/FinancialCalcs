# FinancialCalcs
Overview
The project I’ve completed is a simple application that calculates three different financial calculations.  
The project starts with a disclaimer that the application is not intended to offer financial advice.  
Next, the project asks the user to register in order to use the service.  The application then provides the user with a 
choice of which calculation they’d like to use.  Finally, the application asks the user if they’d like to continue 
using the application, and loops again to the choice selection.  The user can enter ‘q’ to quit.
